# Aclimate CPT python scripts

This repository contains Python scripts used to forecast precipitation for the Aclimate app utilizing the Climate Predictability Tool (CPT).

Folder Structure:

-***temp*** Contains temporary Python scripts generated by each team member during the translation process from R-scripts to Python (e.g individual scripts for each function).
-***01_prediccion.py*** The final script for forecasting precipitation, functioning similarly to the R script "usaid_procesos_interfaz/prediccionClimatica/01_prediccion.R".
-***auxiliary Contains*** scripts that are not directly related to CPT forecasting but provide valuable insights to consider.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the implementation and improvement of the precipitation forecasting feature in the Aclimate app. The team has translated R-scripts to Python, allowing for easier maintenance and integration with the CPT. Additionally, the auxiliary folder houses relevant scripts that can enhance the overall forecasting process.

Please note that the repository might be subject to updates and enhancements as the project progresses.
